# BestChef-Project2

This project was made using MEAN Full stack, 

This app is a recipe application that allows you to create a user as well as recipes. 

The idea is to have an executive chef or simliar log on to the app and create recipes,  and to eventually be able to push that out to their team. The Chef would be able to add in ingredients  from the database, add notes, directions, prep time, origin and any best practices. 
In version 2 somethings that I would add is an admin dashboard, that would show current food cost, any recipes currently in production at the time, and who was currently working on that task, adding in an inventory system, that would keep track of items sold that day and update inventory so that any recipe that requires those ingredients would have a warning and show available substitutes or if none would notify the chef of the problem and allow him to give directions to that person either in person or through the app.
